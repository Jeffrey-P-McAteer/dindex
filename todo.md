# Todo

_A short list of the next things being targeted for implementation_
 
 - Implement LAN UDP multicasting (servers listen, clients _can_ listen, queries get returned directly to sender from all servers)

 - Implement Python FFI library

 - Use Python FFI to write small LAN CLI videogame - records record player names + positions + motion

 - Fix various UDP inconsistencies (listening looks a bit broken)
