# Todo

_A short list of the next things being targeted for implementation_
 
 - Implement Unix and UDP listening

 - Implement signed queries server-side (when all keys are signed any trusted key be able to grant more capabilities/remove anon limits/etc)

 - Implement LAN UDP multicasting (servers listen, clients _can_ listen, queries get returned directly to sender from all servers)
