# Todo

_A short list of the next things being targeted for implementation_
 
 - Implement Unix and UDP listening

 - Implement record signing and verification client-side
  - nice-to-have: a client command to just generate a quick default identity (`~/.dindex.identity{.pub}`?)

 - Implement signed queries server-side (when all keys are signed any trusted key be able to grant more capabilities/remove anon limits/etc)
